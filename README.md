# Awesome Verified Coding Agents

> Resources on AI coding agents using high assurance technniques such as Formal Verification.

Formal Methods is a family of techniques applying mathematical rigor to software engineering. AI coding agents use Large Language Models with iteration and tool feedback to assist with a variety of development tasks, unlocking huge productivity gains *when they work*. By combining these techniques, we hope to enable the widespread creation of software that is highly reliable and maintainable.
